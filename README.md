# Advent of Code

### My stupid solutions as I mess around with a compooter :)

</div>

## Description

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual event where users are given a series of programming challenges to solve, all courtesy of [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). I just want to use multiple languages and have fun solving it. My goal for all years is `30`/50 stars.

By the way, the difficulty is how I feel. It's not a real metric. I'm just a beginner programmer. How I consider it:

- Easy: simple and straightforward, usually brute-force with no optimization.
- Medium: difficulties in parsing, solving, etc. Usually requires some optimization.
- Hard: requires more knowledge, more optimization, and realizing the core of the problem. Usually a brute-force solution won't work.
- Very Hard: requires some obscure algorithmic knowledge. I probably won't be able to do this.

## 2015 - Stars Collection

I want to solve everything in Dyalog APL in this year. The goal is also getting fluent, and becoming comfortable with how APL works.

- Dyalog APL 18.2
- Index Origin: 1

I brute-forced a lot, wow.

**Notes**:

1. Requires an MD5 implementation. I'm not doing that in APL.
2. Removed the assignment line in the input file. Don't know if that's considered cheating or not.
3. Learned that this is a version of TSP. Used brute-force.
4. Part 2's code had a portion copied from [xpqz](https://xpqz.github.io/learnapl/io.html#reading-json-json).
5. 9! permutations of TSP. Brute-forced.
6. Read hints on Reddit for this day. (Still baffled how they notice that)
7. This feels cheated because I only looked for the first group's presents. If there are any ways that with those first group presents, the rest _can't_ be divided evenly, this would be wrong.
