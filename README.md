### My stupid solutions as I mess around with a compooter :)

## Description

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual event where users are given a series of programming challenges to solve, all courtesy of [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).

I just want to use multiple languages and have fun solving it. My goal for this year is `30`/50 stars.

## Stars Collection

By the way, the difficulty is how I feel. It's not a real metric. I'm just a beginner programmer.
